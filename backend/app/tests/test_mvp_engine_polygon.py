"""generate_plan()'s polygon-boundary path (workflow Phase 8). Kept separate
from test_mvp_engine.py's fixture-driven suite since these specs are built
in-line (no polygon fixtures exist yet) and the soundness checks below are
independent of `services.quality.validate`, which is not yet polygon-aware
(that's Slice B) — asserting `validate(plan) == []` here would be checking a
property this slice doesn't guarantee, not the geometry it actually produces.
