"""Hard geometric validator (workflow Step 1.3).

Pure function over a LayoutPlan; no I/O, no engine imports beyond schemas and
Rect math. Used three ways: engine self-check (Phase 1 tests), the
/api/validate editor-sync endpoint (Phases 4/7 — called on every drop, so it
must stay fast), and the reject tier of the scorer (Phase 6).

Violation codes (stable API): overlap, out_of_bounds, below_min_size,
unreachable, missing_requested_room, through_room_access,
staircase_alignment.

Reachability walks the access graph derived from doors: each door's midpoint
connects every room whose boundary touches that point (interior doors connect
two rooms; the front door touches one and adds no edge). The walk starts from
the entry room, or the first room if no entry exists (hand-built plans).
Aligned stair/lift instances connect consecutive floors; geometry on different
floors otherwise remains independent.

``through_room_access`` (workflow Phase 4.5, the privacy-chain check): a
room with ``privacy_level >= 2`` (bedrooms, offices, ... — see
``catalog.privacy_level_for``) must not be reachable ONLY by walking
through another such room. Implemented by re-walking the same door graph
with every OTHER privacy_level>=2 room deleted; if the room drops out of
the reachable set, its only path required passing through a private
neighbour. The one exception: a MUST-adjacency partner (an ensuite through
its own bedroom is working as intended, not a defect) — that specific
partner is never deleted from the walk. Only checked for rooms the plain
reachability walk above already found reachable, so a genuinely
disconnected room is reported once, as ``unreachable``, not twice.

``requirements`` is optional (Packet 7.1 — prompt-to-program truth gate): the
fast per-drop editor endpoint has no RequirementsSpec to compare against and
must keep validating geometry only, so passing it stays opt-in and
backward-compatible. When supplied (the scorer always has one), a requested
room type/count entirely missing from the plan is a hard violation, not a
soft-scored warning — the engine already guarantees exact requested counts,
so a shortfall here means the source requirements or a later edit dropped a
requested room, and quality must not call that layout satisfactory.
