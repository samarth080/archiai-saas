"""layout_engine/search.py — workflow Phase 5.1: generate-and-score
candidate search.

The production MVP API uses :func:`best_candidate` for rectangular plots.
Every candidate flows through the exact same proven ``engine.plan_from_program``
pipeline ``generate_plan()`` itself uses, parameterized by a room-order-
shuffled copy of the same ``EngineProgram`` — so a candidate carries the
identical zero-overlap/zero-gap/reachability guarantees a single-shot plan
already has; search only varies WHICH valid layout comes out, never how
validity itself is checked.

Variation axis implemented: placement-order permutation of the program's
room list (a seeded shuffle). ``subdivide()``'s cumulative-area halving and
the archetype band-grouping helpers are order-sensitive, so different
orderings genuinely produce different geometries through the exact same
deterministic code — no new placement logic needed. The doc's other three
axes (per-archetype parameter jitter, a subdivision cut-axis bias, splitting
the candidate budget across the top-2 viable archetypes) are deferred — a
bounded first slice, same practice as every other phase in this workflow.

Phase 5.2 (``_anneal``, wired in via ``anneal_iterations``): the workflow's
"optional switch" second PR — local search around the best-of-n winner's
own room order via simulated annealing (single-swap neighbor moves,
Metropolis acceptance, geometric cooling), rather than best-of-n's
independent random restarts. Off by default (``anneal_iterations=0``)
everywhere, matching the doc's own "add another optimizer only when
benchmarks show a remaining need" stance; callers opt in explicitly.
Same "can only take over when it demonstrably wins" competition already
used throughout this codebase (Sprint 18's graph-vs-tiler selection,
Phase 9's archetype retry) — annealing tracks its best-seen plan
separately from its current (possibly-worse, accepted-to-explore) walk
state, so it can never hand back anything worse than the best-of-n
winner it started from.
