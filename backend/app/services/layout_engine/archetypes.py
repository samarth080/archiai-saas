"""Layout archetypes (workflow Phase 3.1a) — pure functions from an
``EngineProgram`` to a :class:`BandPlan` (which band holds which rooms).

``zoned_bands`` generalizes ``engine.py``'s old binary public/private split
(``_bands`` + ``_order_group`` + the residential-only ``PUBLIC_ROOM_TYPES``/
``PRIVATE_ROOM_TYPES`` frozensets) into the doc's "ordered zone progression
public -> semi_private -> private" — driven by the graph/catalog's own
``zone_of`` classification instead of the closed residential ``RoomType``
enum, so any building-type program the graph can represent bands correctly,
not just houses.

``zone_of`` itself is finer-grained than 3 tiers (``public|circulation|
semi_private|service|private|technical|outdoor``, see program_graph.py). An
earlier version of this module gave each of those its own top-level band —
tried against the real fixtures, it starved rooms on ordinary plot sizes: a
"public" band containing only kitchen+living (with entry/balcony/bathrooms
peeled into their own separate bands) came out narrower than kitchen's own
minimum width, even though the *aggregate* of every band's floor comfortably
fit the plot. Splitting a facing-side "circulation" band for something as
small as a foyer, or a same-size "service" band for two bathrooms, isn't how
real plans read anyway. So the 7-value ``zone_of`` is folded into the 3
*macro* bands the doc names (``MACRO_ZONE``) before banding — circulation
joins public, service/technical/outdoor join private (unless a must-adjacency
redistribution moves a service node to its partner's band first).

Subdivision itself (``subdivision.subdivide``) is unchanged and shared by
every archetype; an archetype only decides band *structure* — the rectangles
and which rooms go in each.

``double_loaded_corridor``/``hub_and_spoke``/``open_core`` (workflow 3.1.b-d)
add three more band-structure functions plus the graph-shape selector
(3.2). None of them carve a literal circulation void: Phase 4 is what
actually injects a `corridor` program node and carves `corridor_rects` as
real rects (the field has existed on `BandPlan` since 3.1a and stays empty
here, same as before) — inventing an empty, room-less strip of floor area
before that exists would either leave a real gap in the tiled plot (breaking
the zero-gap guarantee every fixture/property test relies on) or require
fabricating a room nobody asked for. So here "corridor"/"hub"/"core" are
purely *band-grouping* ideas — which rooms cluster together and in what
shape — not carved voids; that's the honest, smaller thing that still makes
each archetype meaningfully different in code and in the resulting room
layout, without overclaiming Phase 4 geometry:

- ``double_loaded_corridor``: the public/circulation group anchors the
  facing edge (like ``zoned_bands``), but everything else is split into TWO
  parallel wings side by side (the perpendicular axis) instead of one deep
  band — alternating repeat units (bedrooms, classrooms, consultation
  rooms, ...) between them.
- ``hub_and_spoke``: the single highest-``circulation_weight`` public node
  becomes its own facing-anchored band (an "oversized center", sized the
  same floor-then-slack way every band is), must-adjacent spokes ordered
  first in the remaining band.
- ``open_core``: the single largest-area node (of any zone) anchors the
  facing edge; everyone else is one band behind it.

A literal ring/O-shaped hub-with-spokes-on-all-sides, or a true carved
corridor strip, both need real polygon/void support this engine's guillotine
subdivider does not have (and are exactly the kind of thing Phase 4's
`circulation.py` and Phase 10.2's polygon geometry exist for) — not
attempted here.
