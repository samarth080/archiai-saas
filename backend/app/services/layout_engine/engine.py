"""RequirementsSpec -> LayoutPlan orchestrator (workflow Step 1.2, banding
generalized in Phase 3.1a).

Pipeline: build the program graph (auto-entry, master rule is upstream in the
spec) -> archetypes.zoned_bands assigns rooms to an ordered N-zone band
progression (public/circulation/semi_private/service/private/..., driven by
the graph's own catalog-based zone_of, not a residential-only enum) -> split
the plot into those bands, facing-side first -> recursive subdivision per
band -> leaf min-size check (a room that would fall below its sizing-table
minimum raises DoesNotFitError — the structured "plot too small" the API
turns into a clarification) -> emit deduplicated walls (one wall per shared
edge) -> place doors (must-adjacency first, then a BFS spanning tree from the
circulation room so the access graph is connected by construction, plus the
front door on the entry's facing wall).

For `floors > 1`, the graph is partitioned without splitting MUST components,
an aligned stair/lift core is pre-carved, and this same placement/door pipeline
runs independently per level. Coordinates remain floor-local and every emitted
room, wall, and door carries its zero-based floor. Rooms use rotation=0.

Polygon boundary path (workflow Phase 8): when `spec.plot.boundary` is set on a
single-floor brief, `generate_plan` dispatches to `_generate_plan_polygon`
instead — a parallel
pipeline (own subdivider, own wall builder) that mirrors this one structurally
but operates on a general straight-edge polygon rather than plot_w x plot_d.
It is deliberately NOT unified with the rect path: GEOS/shapely floating-point
arithmetic is not guaranteed bit-identical to the exact `Rect` arithmetic this
file already leans on (see the "round EDGES, not x/w independently" comment
below — this file has been bitten by float-path drift before), so routing
every rectangular plot through shapely for a superficially cleaner abstraction
would mean re-proving float-for-float equivalence against the whole existing
test suite. Two smaller parallel functions is the safer, smaller diff.
`_place_doors` below is reused UNCHANGED by both paths — it only ever reads
`RoomNeed`/`Wall`/wall-length, never the shape type, confirmed genuinely
shape-agnostic.
