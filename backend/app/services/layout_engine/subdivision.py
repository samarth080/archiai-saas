"""Recursive rectangular subdivision (workflow Step 1.2, core).

Splits a band rectangle among an ORDERED list of room needs by balanced
area-weighted guillotine cuts: the list is halved at the cumulative-area
midpoint, the rect is cut along its longer side proportionally to the halves'
areas, and recursion continues. Because every cut tiles its rect exactly, the
result fills the band with zero gaps and zero overlaps by construction — the
sliver-merge rule of the workflow is structurally unnecessary here.

Adjacency is a SOFT preference expressed in list order (the caller chains
`must`-adjacent rooms consecutively): consecutive rooms tend to land in the
same half and end up as edge-sharing siblings. No constraint solving in v0,
exactly as the workplan prescribes.

Facing bias: the first group of the ordered list is assigned the facing-side
child rect, so entry-first ordering pulls the entry toward the plot's facing
edge.
