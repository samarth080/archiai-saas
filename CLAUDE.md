# ArchiAI — CLAUDE.md

This file is the source of truth for any AI agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini, or other) working on this codebase. Read it fully before making any changes.

## What This Project Is

ArchiAI is an AI-powered architectural design platform. Users enter a natural language design brief and receive a 3D architectural layout they can view, edit, and refine in an interactive browser-based canvas.

Full product strategy: [`docs/PROJECT_STRATEGY.md`](docs/PROJECT_STRATEGY.md)
Sprint 1 design spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-sprint1-auth-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-sprint1-auth-design.md)

## Multi-Agent Environment

**This code is written by Claude and reviewed by other agents including Codex.**

Rules for all agents:
- Read this file and the relevant spec before touching any code
- Do not change the project structure without updating this file
- Do not introduce dependencies not listed in the tech stack below without flagging it
- Do not modify another agent's completed and committed work without a clear reason documented in the commit message
- If you are unsure about scope, read the sprint spec before proceeding
- Leave code cleaner than you found it — fix obvious issues in files you touch, but do not refactor unrelated code

If you are Codex or another reviewing agent:
- Check code against the spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/`
- Flag any deviation from the agreed design
- Do not auto-fix — report findings so the lead agent (Claude) can action them

- [x] TypeScript compilation clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [x] Canvas placeholder in place for Sprint 4

### Sprint 4 — Basic 3D Canvas ✅ Complete

- [x] R3F canvas renders in the Project workspace with correct lighting and grid
- [x] Camera orbits, zooms, and pans with mouse (OrbitControls)
- [x] 5 hardcoded room boxes visible, each a different color
- [x] Clicking a room selects it (emissive highlight) and opens the Inspector panel
- [x] Clicking empty canvas deselects (Inspector closes)
- [x] TransformControls gizmo appears on selected room; dragging it moves the room
- [x] OrbitControls disabled while TransformControls is active (no camera fighting)
- [x] Inspector X/Z fields and size fields update/move the room in real time
- [x] Delete button in inspector removes the room from the scene
- [x] Canvas state is in-memory only (persistence in Sprint 7)
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- [x] 8 canvas store tests passing

### Sprint 5 — Basic 3D Layout Generation ✅ Complete

- [x] Layout JSON includes `metadata.totalFloors`, `building.floorHeight`, and `floors[]`
- [x] Multi-floor layouts assign each generated object to exactly one floor
- [x] Multi-floor layouts add simple aligned `Stairs` placeholders on every floor

- [x] Design and first DesignVersion models/migration added for generated layouts
- [x] Project-scoped generation saves layout JSON to Design and DesignVersion when `projectId` is supplied
- [x] Project workspace generation sends `projectId` so generated layouts are saved for the project

- [x] Single-floor layouts continue to render and edit through the backward-compatible top-level `rooms` structure
- [x] Multi-floor layouts render through `floors[]`; selected floor mode edits one floor, All Floors shows stacked elevations
- [x] Project workspace loads the latest saved Design layout for the project when available
- [x] Save Layout persists edited layout JSON to Design and creates a new DesignVersion
- [x] `PUT /api/design/{design_id}` logs `"layout.saved"` through ActivityLog

## Development Rules

- **Never hardcode secrets.** All credentials and keys go in `.env` (gitignored). Use `.env.example` for documentation.
- **Never push directly to `main`.** Use feature branches. Branch naming: `sprint-1/feature-name`.
- **Write tests before or alongside code**, not after.
- **Every significant action must be logged.** Canvas edits, generation events, team changes — all go to `ActivityLog`.
- **Keep modules separate.** Frontend, backend, AI logic, scraper, and logging are distinct. Do not mix concerns.
- **No TODOs in committed code.** If something is deferred, document it in the sprint spec or a GitHub issue.
- **Mouse drag-and-drop in the 3D canvas must work directly.** Inspector editing is a complement, not the primary UX.
- **Auto-save must never overwrite named version history.** Drafts are separate from named versions.
