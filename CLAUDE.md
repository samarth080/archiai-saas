# ArchiAI — CLAUDE.md

This file is the source of truth for any AI agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini, or other) working on this codebase. Read it fully before making any changes.

## What This Project Is

ArchiAI is an AI-powered architectural design platform. Users enter a natural language design brief and receive a 3D architectural layout they can view, edit, and refine in an interactive browser-based canvas.

Full product strategy: [`docs/PROJECT_STRATEGY.md`](docs/PROJECT_STRATEGY.md)
Sprint 1 design spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-sprint1-auth-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-23-sprint1-auth-design.md)

## Multi-Agent Environment

**This code is written by Claude and reviewed by other agents including Codex.**

Rules for all agents:
- Read this file and the relevant spec before touching any code
- Do not change the project structure without updating this file
- Do not introduce dependencies not listed in the tech stack below without flagging it
- Do not modify another agent's completed and committed work without a clear reason documented in the commit message
- If you are unsure about scope, read the sprint spec before proceeding
- Leave code cleaner than you found it — fix obvious issues in files you touch, but do not refactor unrelated code

If you are Codex or another reviewing agent:
- Check code against the spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/`
- Flag any deviation from the agreed design
- Do not auto-fix — report findings so the lead agent (Claude) can action them

## Development Rules

- **Never hardcode secrets.** All credentials and keys go in `.env` (gitignored). Use `.env.example` for documentation.
- **Never push directly to `main`.** Use feature branches. Branch naming: `sprint-1/feature-name`.
- **Write tests before or alongside code**, not after.
- **Every significant action must be logged.** Canvas edits, generation events, team changes — all go to `ActivityLog`.
- **Keep modules separate.** Frontend, backend, AI logic, scraper, and logging are distinct. Do not mix concerns.
- **No TODOs in committed code.** If something is deferred, document it in the sprint spec or a GitHub issue.
- **Mouse drag-and-drop in the 3D canvas must work directly.** Inspector editing is a complement, not the primary UX.
- **Auto-save must never overwrite named version history.** Drafts are separate from named versions.
